# Kidney-Stone-Recognition-using-machine-learning

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting kidney stones using image processing and machine learning techniques. The implementation involves preprocessing ultrasound images, applying various filtering techniques, and ultimately detecting the presence of kidney stones.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Enhancing image quality using filters.
- **Thresholding & Segmentation**: Applying Otsu's thresholding for better segmentation.
- **Noise Removal**: Utilizing Gaussian and Median filters.
- **Stone Detection**: Identifying and marking kidney stones in ultrasound images.

## Dataset
The project uses ultrasound images of kidneys for training and testing. The preprocessing pipeline includes converting images to grayscale, thresholding, noise removal, and filtering.

## Workflow
1. **Input Image**: Load the ultrasound image.
2. **Preprocessing**: Apply grayscale conversion and noise reduction.
3. **Thresholding**: Use Otsuâ€™s method for segmentation.
4. **Filling Operation**: Enhance the detected regions.
5. **Final Preprocessing**: Refine the image.
6. **Filtering**: Apply Gaussian and Median filters for better feature extraction.
7. **Stone Detection**: Identify and highlight kidney stones.

## Dependencies
